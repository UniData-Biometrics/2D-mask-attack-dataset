# 2D Mask Attack Dataset - 26 436 videos
The dataset comprises **26,436** videos of real faces, **2D print attacks** (printed photos), and **replay attacks** (faces displayed on screens), captured under varied conditions. Designed for **attack detection** research, it supports the development of robust **face antispoofing** and **spoofing detection** methods, critical for **facial recognition security**. — **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/2d-printed-mask-and-replay-attack-videos-dataset/?utm_source=github-biometrics&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=2D-mask-attack-dataset)**
